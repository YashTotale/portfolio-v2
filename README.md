   git clone https://github.com/YashTotale/portfolio-v2.git
   cd portfolio-v2
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables

   Please reach out to me at totaleyash@gmail.com for these üôÇ. Paste them into `.env`. Use [`.env.example`] as an example:

   npm run data
   ```

6. Start local development

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

## üèÜ Goals

As you may have noticed, this is my second attempt at a portfolio website. The [first one](https://github.com/YashTotale/portfolio-v1) was ... a total failure. **600+ commits** in, I realized that I had overcomplicated and under-planned the project. Instead of focusing on a clean and intuitive UI, I had gotten bogged down in adding relatively useless features that I thought were cool (like dynamic [Wikipedia](https://github.com/YashTotale/portfolio-v1/blob/master/src/Scripts/getTerms.ts) & [LinkedIn](https://github.com/YashTotale/portfolio-v1/blob/master/src/Scripts/getLinkedin.ts) integration). So, to avoid another failure, I set a few goals ahead of time:

### Start with a design

I used [Figma](https://figma.com/) to design almost all of the website's pages before I even started programming. This helped me quickly build an MVP of the entire website. From there, I was able to optimize and improve specific areas without losing sight of the overall picture.

### Use an efficient CMS

I used [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) for my headless CMS. This allowed me to separate out my website's layout and its content, reducing the amount of changes I would need to make to the code over time. Also, Contentful was a much better alternative to Google Sheets (which I used for my first portfolio website).

### Build sustainable infrastructure

If you browse through the [Components], [Pages], or [Utils] folders, you'll see quite a few patterns in each. This is on purpose: by "_patternizing_" my code, I was able to quickly add new features/pages or make edits to existing UI.

## üß± Architecture

### [Components]

**Components are divided into 4 folders: [Atomic], [Content], [Custom], and [Static]**

#### [Atomic]

Atomic components are those that can be used essentially anywhere. They are meant to be building blocks for layouts, with specific styling/UI to make the website consistent.

#### [Content]

Content components are meant to be UI for a specific type of content. They can be further divided into Main, Preview, Overlay/Mini/Associated.

- Main content components are to be displayed on that specific content's own page. For example, on the route `/experience/<slug>`, the Main component for that specific experience will be displayed.
- Preview content components are to be displayed on the content type's page. For example, on the route `/experience`, the Preview components for all experiences will be displayed.
- The other content components such as Overlay, Mini, and Associated are to be displayed anywhere else as "supporting" components. For example, on a specific tag's page (`/tags/<slug>`), the related experience, articles, and projects of the tag will also be displayed via Overlay components.

#### [Custom]

Custom components are extensively configured components (like a [Rich Text renderer](https://github.com/YashTotale/portfolio-v2/tree/master/src/Components/Custom/RichText)) that can be used in multiple areas of the application. They are generally not atomic as they are meant for a very specific purpose.

#### [Static]

Static components are rendered only once. These include elements like the Navbar, Footer, Sidebar, etc.

### [Pages]

Each page of the website is a folder in the [Pages] directory (except the [NotFound] page). Each of these folders contains an `index.tsx` file which contains the UI for that page.

- Every page calls a [`useAnalytics`] hook, which logs a `page_view` event to [Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com/) if the environment is a production environment.
- Every page updates the `<head>` of the HTML using [React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet).

### [Utils]

Any utilities such as [functions](https://github.com/YashTotale/portfolio-v2/blob/master/src/Utils/funcs.ts), [types](https://github.com/YashTotale/portfolio-v2/blob/master/src/Utils/types.ts), [constants](https://github.com/YashTotale/portfolio-v2/blob/master/src/Utils/constants.ts), etc. are located in the [Utils] folder.

Additionally, content utilities are located in the [Content subdirectory]. All the files in this folder correspond to a specific content type. They contain utilities to get, resolve, filter, and sort that specific content type.

## üõ† Pre-rendering

Pre-rendering is a way to generate static HTML files for a SPA. I used pre-rendering largely to boost page-load times and SEO. Learn more about its benefits on the [react-snap GitHub page](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap).

Sounds pretty simple, but there are a few caveats with pre-rendering that took a _little_ while for me to debug.

### Pre-rendering in CI/CD

[react-snap](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap) and other pre-rendering libraries use [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) to launch a headless Chrome browser to crawl your site's web pages and generate HTML files.

This works great locally, however if you're pre-rendering in a CI/CD step, you have to include some extra configuration for puppeteer to work properly. Here is what you need to include in your project's `package.json`:

```json
"reactSnap": {
  "puppeteerArgs": [
    "--no-sandbox",
    "--disable-setuid-sandbox",
    "--disable-gpu"
  ]
}
```

### Pre-rendering with API requests

If you attempt to pre-render your website with API requests or something similar (ex. Google Analytics event logging) enabled, you'll likely face `Navigation Timeout Exceeded` or `Protocol Error` issues. There's a simple fix for this: **just don't make those calls during the pre-rendering stage.** Here's how:

```javascript
if (navigator.userAgent !== "ReactSnap") {
  // Do your requests here
}
```
