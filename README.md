## üèÜ Goals

As you may have noticed, this is my second attempt at a portfolio website. The [first one](https://github.com/YashTotale/portfolio-v1) was ... a total failure. 600+ commits in, I realized that I had overcomplicated and under-planned the project. Instead of focusing on a clean and intuitive UI, I had gotten bogged down in adding relatively useless features that I thought were cool (like dynamic [Wikipedia](https://github.com/YashTotale/portfolio-v1/blob/master/src/Scripts/getTerms.ts) & [LinkedIn](https://github.com/YashTotale/portfolio-v1/blob/master/src/Scripts/getLinkedin.ts) integration). So, to avoid another failure, I set a few goals ahead of time:

### Start with a design

I used [Figma](https://figma.com/) to design almost all of the website's pages before I even started programming. This helped me quickly and efficiently write the UI for

### Use an efficient CMS

I used [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) for my headless CMS. This allowed me to separate out my website's layout and its content, reducing the amount of changes I would need to make to the code over time. Also, Contentful was a much better alternative to Google Sheets (which I used for my first portfolio website).

### Build sustainable infrastructure

If you browse through the [Components], [Pages], or [Utils] folders, you'll see quite a few patterns in each. This is on purpose: by "patternizing" my code, I am able to quickly add new features/pages or make edits to existing UI.
